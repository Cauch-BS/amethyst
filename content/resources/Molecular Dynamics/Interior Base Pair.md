A secondary structure on a sequence $(a_i)_{1\le i \le n}$ is a subset of $S \subset \{i:1\le i \le n\} \times \{i: 1 \le i \le n\}$. It is known that for all $(i,j)$ and $(k.l)$ in $S$ that 
$$i =k \iff j = l \tag{1}$$
$$k < j \implies i < k < l < j \tag{2}$$
A base pair $(k, l) \in S$ is called **interior** to $(i,j)$ if the relation $i < k < l < j$ holds. If $k$ is the minimum integer for which there exists such $l$ that $(k, l)$ is interior to $(i, j)$, the base pair $(k, l)4 is called **immediately interior** to $(i, j)$.
