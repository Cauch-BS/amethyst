For a completely isolated system (e.g. the universe) , $N$ (the number of particles), $V$ (the volume), $E$ (the energy) is assumed to be constant. The thermodynamics of an isolated system is described by the *micro canonical ensemble*.  Generally, the *micro-canonical ensemble* has a  discrete probability distribution and thus cannot have a partition function (which is defined in the context of continuous probability distribution). The probability of a micro-state $\Gamma$ is
$$\begin{align} \mathbb{P}(\Gamma) &= \dfrac{1}{\Omega(E)}  \\&= \exp\left(-\dfrac{S}{k_B}\right)\end{align}$$
where $S$ is the entropy. Thus, the most likely configuration is that configuration for which $S$ is maximized. 

The partition function can be derived by the discrete probability distribution in terms of the Dirac Delta function, as so:
$$Z = \sum_{\Gamma}\delta(\mathcal{H} - E)$$
