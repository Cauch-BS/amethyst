A secondary structure $S$ can be decomposed in a unique way into a number of distinct substructures. Consider the $k-$cycle as determined by the number of [[Accessible Bases|accessible base pairs]] that are [[Interior Base Pair|interior]] to a base pair $(i,j)$. 

If $k=1$, the $u$ terms between $i$ and $j$ are said to form a **hairpin** loop. 

If $k=2$ and $u=0$, the pair $(i+1, j-1)$ and $(i,j)$ together form a **stacked** base pair. If $k=2$ and $u >0$, the $2$-cycle closed by $i$ and $j$ form a **bulge** or an **interior loop**. If either one of $i+1$ and $j-1$ form a pair within $S$, the structure is said to be a bulge. Otherwise the $2$-cycle is called an interior loop. (See [[Figure of RNA Secondary Structures|Figure]]) 

A $k$-cycle where $k>2$ is called a **multiloop** or **multiple loop**. 

A sequence term that is not contained in any $k$-cycle is called an external base. 

It is trivial that every term is either part of a **hairpin**, **base pair stack**, **interior loop**, **bulge** or multiple loop.
