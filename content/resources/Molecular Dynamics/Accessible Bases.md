Meanwhile, for $r$ between the base pair $(i,j)$ such that $i< r < j$ but if $S$ contains no pair $x, y$ s.t. $i <x < r < y < j$, the base $r$ is defined as **accessible** from $(i, j)$. 

For a secondary structure $S$ of a RNA molecule, if $(p,q) \in S$ and both $p$ and $q$ are accessible from $(i, j) \in S$, the pair $(p,q)$ is said to be accessible from $(i, j)$. 

Assume that $(k-1)$ pairs and $u$ unpaired bases are accessible from $(i,j)$. Then these bases within $(i,j)$ are said to constitute a $k$-cycle or $k$-loop closed by $(i, j)$. The accessible $(k-1)$ pairs are called the **interior** pairs, whereas the closing pair is referred to as the **exterior** pair.
